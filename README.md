# basic-fivem-iframe
Change `iframe_url` in `client.lua` to set the URL that the iframe will load when being opened.

Default bind is F10, you can change this in the `client.lua` file. Users will also be able to change the bind themselves via FiveM Keybinds.

## Use with SnailyCAD
If you're using SnailyCAD and have SSL enabled, you will need to enable `SECURE_COOKIES_FOR_IFRAME` in the `.env`, this will then allow SnailyCAD to work inside an iframe.
